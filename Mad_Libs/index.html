            <p>Dear Mrs. [Last Name],</p><br>
            <p>I am truly [adjective] for disrupting yesterday's class on the native customs of the [noun] tribes of (the) [a place]. It was rude of me to burst out [verb ending in 'ing'] when you explained that the tribal cheif wore a/an [color] feathered headpiece in the shape of a winged [noun] on his [part of the body]. And my decision to [verb] in a circle with my [part of body (plural)] outstretched while chanting "[silly word]! [same silly word]!" was very inappropriate. Even though I was only trying to mimic the [adjective] native dance. I understand there's a time and place for that kind of [noun] - and your class was not it. I know that you [verb] very hard as a teacher and deserve respect for teaching me and my fellow [plural noun] every day. I hope you accept my sincere [noun] and believe I will never exercise such [adjective] judgment again.</p><br>
            <p>Sincerely,</p><br>
            <h3>[person in the room]</h3>
